I want a component system that allows certain upgrades to be moved from one tile to another.

Each component has 1 core functionality it almost always adds, and should often have a special quality it adds depending on the tile.
### Current components:
#### [[Heating Component]] 
upgrades a [[Sink]] to a [[Boiling Sink]]
upgrades a [[Prep Table]] to a [[Heated Prep Table]]

upgrades a [[Prep Table]] to a [[Frozen Prep Table]]
