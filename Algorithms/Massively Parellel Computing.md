Sorting problem
variant of quicksort
probibalistic

send random elements to 1 computer
it sorts those and returns their order 
count how many elements in between each sorted element
sum counts
???

Minimal Spanning Forest
E' = E
recursively
- fit E' into as few nodes as possible
- each node calculates local msf(E')
- E' = msf(E')
as long as more edges can fit in machine memory than the maximal spanning forest, this will converge on the solution
