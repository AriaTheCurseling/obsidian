Many games utilize stats as a means of progression, increasing your health, damage and attack speed, reducing cooldowns and otherwise altering numbers as your progress in the game.

It allows for measurable and easily controlled progression. how much stronger a a player is after reaching a certain level or getting a specific item can be calculated by simply comparing the damage before and after.

However, this simplicity also tends to resolve to a distinct lack of depth. which of these two items should I get? whichever gives the most of stat x, since stats are linear, and each character in a game tends to have a set scaling with the stat, the optimal strategy tends to be to maximize that singular stat.

Often, this problem is solved by tying stats together with abilities. you still have an optimal stat to maximize, but now you have a qualitative component to complicate your choice, you need to weight the ability against the stats and think of which is worth more.

That leaves the question, can a stat system be constructed that breaks the maximizer mindset on its own?

milestones - unlock abilities as stats increase
drawbacks - add detrimental effects to stats
opposition - opposing stats decrease each other
diminishing - each increase in stat does less
