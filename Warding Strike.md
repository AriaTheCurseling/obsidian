*You interrupt an opponents action with a defensive attack.*

Certain features let you perform a warding strike as a reaction when an opponent makes a triggering action that meets specific criteria. 

When you perform a warding strike, make an attack against the opponent. The opponent may choose to oppose your attack with the Action Check of the trigering action instead of their AC. 

After results are revealed, the opponent may choose to abandon the triggering action to avoid taking damage from the warding strike.
