###### Guarded Target
You may guard against one target at a time. Your guarded target is never considered to flank you. 

###### Change Guard (1 tempo, react)
Change your guarded target. If your old target is now flanking you, they receive an attack of oppertunity. 

###### Threatening Guard (1 tempo, react)
When your guarded target attempts to move closer than the max range of a melee weapon you're wielding, you may perform a warding strike with that weapon.
