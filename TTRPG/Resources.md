A three resource structure, 
tempo that regens fully every turn
stamina that regens between fights
endurance that regenerates during rests

tempo is spent often and freely, it is considered the cheapest of the resources and is an abstraction of time. 

stamina is spent more sparingly, abstracting exersion both physical and magical. 

endurance is considered a costly resource, covering long term costs.
