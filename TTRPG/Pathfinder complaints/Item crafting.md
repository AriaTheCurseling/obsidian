Item crafting feats are poorly structured, they are seperated by shape instead of effect. 

Potions, weapons and scrolls are fine categories, but wands, rods and wonderous items have weird overlap that the rules do a horrible job of explaining. 


The way pathfinder handles economy with crafting feats is also kinda idiotic. Since you can craft at half the cost of an item, they suggest limiting how much players are allowed to craft for themselves...

now, crafters enhancing their teammates should probably be more limited, but the point of taking crafting feats is being able to have more items than otherwise possible, limiting that arbitrarily sucks.

Crafting in pathfinder is also only possible from gold, with practically no impact based on monsters slain and sp forth, beyond a few special materials like dragonhide and angelskin (so only incrediblt high tiers). You cannot make armor out of the hide of a random beast you slay, you cant even use it for crafting unless you take an additional feat and even then it heavily limits how much value you can get from the monster. Just, whyyyyy. i get not giving players access to too much equipment, but seeking out materials to craft something is cool, making an armor piece from the big beast you killed on your travels is cool.
