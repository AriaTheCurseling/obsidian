pathfinder really likes to reference other classes abilities "as if you had this other thing" or "this functions like". 

This is horrible, it makes things hard to read and makes stacking annoying. 

All abilities should exist seperately from classes, with classes merely being a list of what you get (with the abilities inlined).
