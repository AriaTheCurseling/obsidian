You may perform a Feint in place of any action, paying all normal costs.

A Feint is resolved using the same checks and reactions as the original action, but you may add your Feint Bonus.

Opponents capable of reacting who fail to oppose the Feint are tricked (even if they did not react).

Once before the end of your next turn, you may apply your Feint Bonus when performing the action against a single target you tricked.
