replacement instead of prevention
- There is little worse than your opponent being able to fully ignore what you can do
- On the other side hard CC can often be extremely oppresive
- The solution is *softening* CC instead of *preventing* it

ways to soften CC
- reducing severity - reduce a stun to a root
- breakfree abilities - allow some abilities to be activated at reduced effectiveness to remove the effect
- passthrough abilities - allow limited action that doesn't break the CC
