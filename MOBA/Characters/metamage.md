[Passive] Metamagic:
Cycle through metamagic enhancements on each ability cast.

Hastened - reduces cast time
Precise - smaller hitbox, extra range



[Q] Metabolt:
Shoots a magical bolt that inflicts a debuff on the enemy equivalent to the metamagic used to cast it. 

[W] Diserning gaze:
Look at an enemy studying their every move. If they use an ability while being watched then this ability can be reactivated to replicate the ability cast.

[E] 

[R] Grand Spell:
You next spell is cast as a grand spell. 


----------------------------------------
Metamagic Ideas:
Mobile: Can move while casting

Untethered: Spell casts itself

Hastened: Speeds up time during casting


Echo: A second unthetered cast happens at a slight delay

Fractured: Spell is seperated into multiple casts reduced in every way (cast time, channel, damage, range) 

Quickened: reduce cast and channel time

Reach: Increased range

Hidden: hides the caster in illusions during the cast time (not during channel) 

Ritual: Channel the spell through a ritual, revealing yourself and your spells targeting. Targeting may be slowly changed while channeling. When channel is complete or abandoned, cast an enhanced spelm based on channel duration (cast time also increased)  

Instant: turn projectiles into beams, dashes into teleports, makes dot into one time effect
