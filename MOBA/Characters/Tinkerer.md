##### Q - Swarm
Shoot a slow moving swarm in the target direction. Deal damage.

Hitting your turret briefly empowers it, letting you recast to shoot a long range shot from the turret
Hitting your pylon speeds up and slightly redirects the swarm


##### W - Construct

turret - it shoots, can be destroyed, takes reduced aoe dmg
pylon - small hitbox totem that slows projectiles and dashes briefly on hit
mine - long range, slow cast, interrupted by walking into zone
