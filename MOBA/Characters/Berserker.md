Passive - Fuelled by Emotion

The berserker's motions fuels her abilities, granting them special effects according to her mood. 

Her **Wrath** builds when she is damaged, debuffed or stuned.
Her **Joy** grows when she deals damage, is healed or is buffed. 

Each emotion can build up to 100, determining her mood:

At half **Wrath** she is **Enraged**
At half **Joy** she is **Overjoyed**
If she is both she is **Exhilarated**
If she is neither she is **Serene**

Using an ability when **Enraged**, **Overjoyed** or **Exhilarated** consumes 50 of the relevant emotion.
