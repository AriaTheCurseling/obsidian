Sensors create memories
Memories store information
Goals
Behaviours fulfil goals




Sensors detect things about the world around the mob and store it in Memories

The AI only cares about memories


GOAP:
Defined cost of actions
Full world knowledge      -> Memories & Senses
Distinct action states       -> plan blending
One goal at a time           -> multi goal
Goal Priority                     -> goal fulfilment
	Instead of "eat" goal is "avoid hunger"
	The less fulfilled a goal is the more the agent prioritises it
	Allows for better planning
	Probably with some secondary priority



Examples

Goal - **Nourished**
Action - Eat
	Condition - Have food
	Result - Nourished up, have less food
	Knowledge - Nourishment gained from food item, is poisoned, is edible

Action - Collect
	Condition - Nearby, Memory of item
	Result - Gain item
	Knowledge - Is he

Action - Move
	Result - Change location
