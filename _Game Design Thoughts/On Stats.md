Many games utilize stats as a means of progression, increasing your health, damage and attack speed, reducing cooldowns and otherwise altering numbers as your progress in the game.

It allows for measurable and easily controlled progression. how much stronger a a player is after reaching a certain level or getting a specific item can be calculated by simply comparing the damage before and after.

However, this simplicity also tends to resolve to a distinct lack of depth. which of these two items should I get? whichever gives the most of stat x, since stats are linear, and each character in a game tends to have a set scaling with the stat, the optimal strategy tends to be to maximize that singular stat.

Often, this problem is solved by tying stats together with abilities. you still have an optimal stat to maximize, but now you have a qualitative component to complicate your choice, you need to weight the ability against the stats and think of which is worth more.

That leaves the question, can a stat system be constructed that breaks the maximizer mindset on its own?

milestones - unlock abilities as stats increase
drawbacks - add detrimental effects to stats
opposition - opposing stats decrease each other
diminishing - each increase in stat does less

#### Drawback Stats
Impact/might
- moderately improves effect
- slightly worsens windup

nimble
- moderately improves speed
- slightly worsens self cc
- minesculely smaller hitbox

precision
- smaller hitbox
- longer range

Mettle
- slightly reduce cc
- slight cast progress during cc



Lithe
evation and sprint up
knockback resist down


##### Stability
resource with max and regen

stability is consumed to reduce knockback against the entity. Continuous knockback fights against the regen. 

at full capacity stability will attempt to stop the entire knockback. as capacity lowers so does the percentage ofa knockback stability will cancel (down to x% of knockback when 0% stability)

hitting 0 induces some negative status effect. drasticly reduced efficiency while in air

##### Exhaustion
A way to tie all resources together by making regeneration cause exhaustion, the more exhausted a character is the slower their other stats regenerate. 

the faster another bar regenerates the more its effected by exhaustion, health usually regenerates slowly (if it regenerates at all) so exhaustion has little effect, stamina regenerates fast so is highly affected by exhaustion. 

can easily be automaticly calculated by using a time to fully regen metric
