Pickups can be quite annoying in games, especially when they're everywhere and feel near inconsequential on their own. Larger pickups that noticeably affect gameplay are more fun, more worth the time to divert your path to collect.

Avoid small omnipresent collectibles in general, unless they are the main point of the game.
