Items can be dropped into a boiling cauldron to brew potion, some items are absorbed by this,  others are not, these are called ingredients and catalysts respectively.




example recipe
> 3 bottles of water
> heat until boiling
> 2 pinches of sugar
> stir until dissolved  - hyper potion: short duration speed then slow
> wait until it cools
> add coal and wait for x - continuously reduces both speed and slow duration (more coal is faster)
> fill bottles with potion







Quick notes
- Heat level
- Catalysts *meaning untie or loosen* *si unit is katal*
- Purification
  - evaporations seems doable
  - Crystalization would be cool
  - filtration hard but doable - meh
  - liquid-liquid extraction works with cauldron levels
  - Adsorption *liquid charcoal* - charcoal catalyst
  - Electrolysis *listen, lightning bolt alchemy*
  - Bioleaching *honerable mention, basicly loot bugs* - silverfish?
  - Sublimation not that applicable, but cool *solid to gas skipping liquid*
- Titration *dripstones are perfect!!!*
- Stirring





Curent cauldron interactions:
- Rain
- Snowfall
- Dripstone duplicates liquid

- Dye armor (bedrock only)
- Remove Dye

Cool mod things
- alchemia (cool cauldron)

Items
- Lava bottles - material?
- Powdered snow bottles - material?
