Items can be dropped into a boiling cauldron to brew potion, some items are absorbed by this,  others are not, these are called ingredients and catalysts respectively.












Quick notes
- Heat level
- Catalysts *meaning untie or loosen* *si unit is katal*
- Purification
  - evaporations seems doable
  - Crystalization would be cool
  - filtration hard but doable - meh
  - liquid-liquid extraction works with cauldron levels
  - Adsorption *liquid charcoal* - charcoal catalyst
  - Electrolysis *listen, lightning bolt alchemy*
  - Bioleaching *honerable mention, basicly loot bugs* - silverfish?
  - Sublimation not that applicable, but cool *solid to gas skipping liquid*
- Titration *dripstones are perfect!!!*
- Stirring





Curent cauldron interactions:
- Rain
- Snowfall
